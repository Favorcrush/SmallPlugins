# SmallPlugins
A collection of small plugins written by me that I'll regularly be updating. This repository consists of small plugins that contain simple listeners to extremely simple commands. I'd like to say now that they are not tested and were speed written so please don't complain if they're not working out of the box. Just submit an issue and I'll get back to your endeavour over the next 24 hours.

### Requests
If you have a request for a "small plugin", please create an issue on the issue tracker. I'm accepting (almost) all requests, and will provide download links to anyone interested.
