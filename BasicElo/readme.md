# BasicElo
This file contains a little bit of information about this plugin and it's dependencies. 

#### Dependencies
This plugin uses a library called "PlayerRating" to calculate player ELOs. This is for simplicity, as if we created our own ELO system in this plugin we wouldn't reserve the right to locate it in this repository. If you'd like to use this plugin, please install PlayerRating on your server, the thread can be found here.
